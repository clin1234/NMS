# NMS (ein neues Minensuchspiel)

NMS is (currently) a minesweeper clone written in Java. The GUI uses the Swing API at the moment.

## Status

* Console interface virtually functional.
* GUI is a work in progress.

## Building

Only the console interface works for now. To compile, type `javac NMS/cons.java`. (Replace `/` with `\` in Windows.) To run, type `java NMS.cons`, or directly execute the source file with `java NMS/cons.java`.
