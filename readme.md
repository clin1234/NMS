# NMS (ein neues Minensuchspiel)

NMS is (currently) a minesweeper clone written in Java. The GUI uses the Swing API at the moment.

## Status

* Console interface virtually functional.
* GUI is a work in progress.
* Need artist to draw logo. Logo must be vectored, but you may send images in other formats (such as for desktop icons). Please license subissions under open licenses compatible with the GPL. Email me at <charlielin65@gmail.com>.

## Building

Only the console interface works for now. To compile, type `javac NMS/cons.java`. (Replace `/` with `\` in Windows.) To run, type `java NMS.cons`, or directly execute the source file with `java NMS/cons.java`.
